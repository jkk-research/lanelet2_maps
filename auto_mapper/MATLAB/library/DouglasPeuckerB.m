function result = DouglasPeuckerB(Points,epsilon)
% The Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm (RDP) is an algorithm for reducing 
% the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of 
% points. The initial form of the algorithm was independently suggested 
% in 1972 by Urs Ramer and 1973 by David Douglas and Thomas Peucker and 
% several others in the following decade. This algorithm is also known 
% under the names Douglasé³³eucker algorithm, iterative end-point fit 
% algorithm and split-and-merge algorithm. [Source Wikipedia]

% Input:
%           Points: List of Points, double,  N x [x, y] 
%           epsilon: distance dimension, specifies the similarity between
%           the original curve and the approximated (smaller the epsilon,
%           the curves more similar), integer scalar.
%           Remark: You may add identifiers for the points, then List = N x [x, y, id]
% Output:
%           result: List of Points for the approximated curve M x [x, y],
%                   or M x [x, y, id] if identifiers were included.
% Example:
%           x = [8;  4;  5;  1;  0;  4;  8; 12; 11];
%           y = [0; -2;  2;  4; 10; 14;  8;  2;  0];
%           id = (1:9)';%identifier
%           Points = [x,y,id];
%           epsilon = 3;% Largest perpendicular distance from the new track to the original track
%           result = DouglasPeuckerB(Points,epsilon);
%           figure(1); plot(x,y,'.r-',result(:,1),result(:,2),'.b--'); grid on; axis equal
